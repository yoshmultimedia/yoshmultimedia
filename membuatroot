WARNING! THIS WILL WIPE ALL DATA FROM YOUR DEVICE!

1. Get your android and device version from settings -> about phone -> service provider software version (for me its Seri-Hpmu EUX)
2. Download the latest stock ROM for your specific device from https://samfrew.com/
3. Download and install Odin from https://samsungodin.com/download/
4. Activate developer settings (click 8x on buildnumber)
5. Activate usb debugging from the developer settings
6. Activate OEM Unlocking (THIS WILL WIPE ALL YOUR DATA)
7. After this factory reset, hold down volume up + power to get to the recovery
8. Choose to reboot to bootloader
9. You will be asked if you want to unlock the bootloader, choose yes

10. Put the downloaded stock ROM onto your device (sdcard, internal storage, etc)
11. Download the Magisk app from the Playstore
12. Open Magisk and hit install
13. Select the downloaded stock ROM from your storage and wait for the process
14. Copy the magisk-modified ROM to your PC

15. Pack the magisk-modified ROM in a TAR and flash as "AP" with Odin
16. Let the phone boot and complete the initial setup
17. Open Magisk and reboot if suggested
(18. Go into Magisk again, go to Settings and enable Zygisk
19. and reboot again)

Magisk should now show the current version in "installed" and apps can request superuser access now. If "installed" shows n/a then magisk root did not work.

If anything fails, you should always be able to press the powerbutton + volume up to get to the bootloader (big blue screen) and flash the AP of the stock rom.

Need help with:
- Patch dm-verity/vbmeta (to install a custom recovery)
- Porting TWRP to Exynos1380 kernel
